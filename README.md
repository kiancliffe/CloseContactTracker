# CloseContactTracker

Create a Java application with a gui to keep track of close contacts for people in order for a person to be able to inform people (close contacts) that they may be at risk of covid if/when the person tests positive for covid. To solve this object oriented programming was used with javafx for the gui and a mysql database to store the information.
